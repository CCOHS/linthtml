> An unofficial html5 linter and validator.

lintHTML uses [htmlparser2] to parse your html. It then uses the provided rules (and default rules) to lint both the DOM and then individual lines. [Take a look at the supported options](https://github.com/KamiKillertO/lintHTML/wiki/Options).

## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=6.14), npm version 3+.

There are two ways to install lintHTML: globally and locally.

### Local Installation and Usage

If you want to include lintHTML as part of your project's build system, we recommend installing it locally. You can do so using npm:

```shell
npm install linthtml --save-dev
```

You should then set up a configuration file:

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/linthtml --init
```

After that, you can run lintHTML on any file or directory like this:

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/linthtml yourfile.html
```

### Global Installation and Usage

If you want to make lintHTML available to tools that run across all of your projects, we recommend installing lintHTML globally. You can do so using npm:

```shell
npm install -g linthtml
```

You should then set up a configuration file:

```shell
linthtml --init
```

After that, you can run lintHTML on any file or directory like this:

```shell
linthtml yourfile.js
```

<!-- Note: `linthtml --init` is intended for setting up and configuring linthtml on a per-project basis and will perform a local installation of ESLint and its plugins in the directory in which it is run. If you prefer using a global installation of ESLint, any plugins used in your configuration must also be installed globally. -->

### Other

We have a some other solutions to run linthtml

This module doesn't provide any interface on its own. It is highly recommended that
you use one of the following modules to run the linter:

* [`gulp-linthtml`](https://github.com/linthtml/gulp-linthtml): a gulp interface for lintHTML (Coming soon ðŸš§)
* [`linthtml-loader`](https://github.com/linthtml/linthtml-loader): lintHTML loader for webpack (Coming soon ðŸš§)
* [`broccoli-linthtml`](https://github.com/linthtml/broccoli-linthtml): Integrates HTML linting with lintHTML as part of your Broccoli build pipeline. (Coming soon ðŸš§)

## Getting Started with Contributing

You can use lintHTML in Node.JS by using

```js
require('lintHTML')

in your code, and doing an install with  

```shell

(Remember `--save-dev` if this is just for your development).
