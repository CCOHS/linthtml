# Changelog

## v0.6.0-beta.2

## Refactor üß∞

### Remove [yaml package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml

LintHTML now use [js-yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml) insteal of [yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml) to generate the content of the configuration file (yaml format ^^). The package [js-yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml) was already available thanks to [cosmiconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig) so it was unnecessary to add a other package to deal with yaml.

### Run indent-x rules on every node

Previously, the rules `indent-style`, `indent-width`(...) were only run on the root tag of the HTML document linted. The other tags were accessed and checked by accessing the list of children nodes of the root tag (and the children nodes of the children...). This used to works, indent issues were reported correctly but by doing this, it was not possible to deactivate the rules for a specific part of the document using an inline config.

Now, the rules is executed per node which make it possible to enable/disable the rules for a part of the DOM using an inline config.

## v0.6.0-beta.1

### Features üöÄ

### Shareable configuration

It's now possible to use and extends [shareable configurations](./docs/shareable-configs.md) in LintHTML.
Shareable configuration can be extended in a `.linthtmlrc*` file using the keyword `extends`.

```json
{
    "extends": "my-linthtml-config",
    "rules": {
      // ...
    }
}
```

‚ö† Shareable configuration can only be used with the [new config format](./docs/migrations.md#030-upgrade-guide).

To learn more about shareable configuration and how to use them you can read the [documentation](./docs/configuration.md#extending-configuration-files).

## v0.5.1

### Fix üõ†Ô∏è

- Generate JSON config file with correct json object inside.
- Use `Object.defineProperty` to add `attributes` property to AST node and fix a runtime error.

## v0.5.0

### Features üöÄ

#### New rule

Add the rule `no-surrounding-whitespace` disallowing the presence of encapsulating whitespace.
For example the following code will report an error:

```html
<p>  A simple text with whitespaces before</p>
```

You can find more informations in the [rule doc](./lib/rules/no-surrounding-whitespace/README.md).

#### Improve config file search

Now, for each file linted, LintHTML will look for a config file in the file local folder.
If a config file is found, LintHTML will use it. If there's no config file LintHTML will check each parent folder and stop once it finds a config file or reaches the `HOME` folder.

### Print error for invalid rule config

LintHTML will now report an error if a rule is not correctly activated in the new config format.
For example, the following patterns will now print errors in the console.

```
// Valid string values are "error", "warning" and "off"
"rule-name": "foo" 

// Only string, boolean and array are accepted
"rule-name": 1 
"rule-name": {}

// If an array is provided, the first value should be a valid string or a boolean
"rule-name": [1, rule_config] 
"rule-name": ["foo", rule_config]
"rule-name": [{}]

```

### Breaking change ‚ö†Ô∏è (old config)

Remove the possibility to use [presets in inline config](https://github.com/htmllint/htmllint/wiki/Inline-Configurations#presets). This feature was not documented in LintHTML and not available when using the new config format.

### Improvements üîß

#### HTML parser improvments

Upgrade [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2) and improve outputed AST to extract more informations about nodes, for example now a node element:

- contains all attributes event the duclicated and know the start and end location for each.
- has more informations about open/close tags

All nodes now include a property `loc` containing start and end position (line/column).

Thanks to the AST improvements somme rules have been updated to better target the errors locations.

Create some utils functions to check rules config and have unified error messages.

### Features üöÄ

### Improve config file search
