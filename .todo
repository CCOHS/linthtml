## refactor

* `raw-ignore-text` Find a better solution than the current one
* Get rid of the process function in rules. Config send to rules should be the same as the one defined in the config file
  This funciton should be changed for a validation function that raise errors if config is not valid
* No rules by default
* Tests should assert issues too (code, position...)
* Improve creation of the linter
  This
  ```javascript
    const linthtml = require("../../../index");
    const none = require('../../../presets').presets.none;
    function createLinter() {
      return new linthtml.Linter(linthtml.rules);
    }
    const linter = createLinter();
    const html = "<body><style>hello</style></body>";
    linter.lint(html, none, { "attr-bans": ["style"] })
  ```

  Should be:

  ```javascript
    const linthtml = require("../../../index");
    
    function createLinter(rules) {
      return new linthtml.Linter(rules);
      // or // return new linthtml(rules);
    }
    const linter = createLinter({ "attr-bans": ["style"] });
    const html = "<body><style>hello</style></body>";
    linter.lint(html)
  ```

* move rules tests in the rule folder
  

## deprecate rules

  - input-radio-req-name can be merged with input-req-name (don't exist yet)
  - indent-delta don't understand this rule
  - raw-ignore-regex it's no really a rule (maybe a options for the linter, but i'm not sure we should keep this option)
  - maxerr convert in max maxWarn instead ?
  - id-class-style
  - attr-new-line: Get rid of "0+"
  
## Fix rules naming convention

* complete mane :
  - req => require
  - len => length
  - dup => duplicate

## Correct rules

* Merge `attr-name-style` and `attr-name-ignore-regex` (this one should be an option of the first)
* `attr-req-value` should report an error for empty values (`''` or `""`). Can be an option like `strict`
* `attr-req-value` should permit to whitelist attributes that can have no value (default should be boolean attributes like `disable`)
* `attr-validate` should not accept `\b` `\t` in attributes's value 
* `class-style` get rid of `bem` format ? Tests seems not valid and it's hard to tel what's BEM or not
* merge `doctype-first` and `doctype-html5` (html5 should be an option (should be be default too ?))
* `doctype-first` `smart` should be an option. `smart` should not report if doctype + html + head not present ?
* `doctype-first` should return an error if first element is plain text (plain text is in fact a textNode)
* `fig-req-figcaption`report error when figcaption is empty
* `focusable-tab-index-style` rename the rule
* `id-class-no-ad` deprecate this one ? Why not allow `ad`, `social`... in id or class ? (Can be replaced by a rule that ban word in attributes (using a regexp))

## Improve inline config

* The `preset` thing is totally overkill, hard to understand >< and not documented very well.
* The `$previous` thing  is totally overkill and hard to understand >< , Maybe we can keep this one).

Add `.linthtml-disable ?[rules]` and `.linthtml-enable ?[rules]`

`linthtml-configure` should accept only one rule, something like

`linthtml-configure [rule] [value]`
